# Hypothesis-Test-ANOVA
Learning ANOVA Analysis

#ANOVA = Analysis of variance
#It is a statistical technique that is used to check if the "MEANS' of two or more groups are significantly different from each other.
#In anova will compare more than TWO groups
#Anova is similar to t-test ,tha difference is that if you want to compare more than two groups will go with anova.

#Case Study: A drug company tested three formulations of a pain relief medicine for migration headache sufferers.
#for the experiment 27 volunteers were selected and 9 were randomly assigned to one of three drug formulations.
#The subject were instructed to take the drug during their next migraine headache episode and to report their pain on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being most pain).

#Data given:
#DRUG A = 4 5 4 3 2 4 3 4 4
#DRUG B = 6 8 4 5 4 6 5 8 6
#DRUG C = 6 7 6 6 7 5 6 5 5

# Here, we have to compare whether all three medicine giving same effect or not
#If'MEAN' is same i.e. means all three medicine are effective
#If'MEAN' is different i.e. means out of three only one or two medicine is effective.

# Define Ho and Ha
#Null Ho = MEAN of all group is same
#Alter Ha= MEAN of all group is NOT same
